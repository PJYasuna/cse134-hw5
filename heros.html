                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skill 1: Precision Targeting.</strong> Attacks the enemy with gunfire, and increases Combat Readiness of the caster by 20%. After attacking, has a 40% to activate Salvo Fire as an extra attack.
Salvo Fire: Attacks all enemies by firing off artillery, and recovers Health of the caster. Amount recovered increases proportional to the caster's Attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill 2: Ruler of the Sea.</strong> Immune to debuffs which prevent movement and increases Critical Hit Resistance by 50%. At the start of battle, increases Critical Hit Resistance of all allies except for the caster for 2 turns. After attacking, increases Attack of the caster by 10%. This effect can stack up to 5 times.
Debuffs Which Prevent Movement: Stun, Sleep.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill 3: Mobilize the Warship!</strong> After increasing Attack of the caster for 3 turns, attacks all enemies with a warship, stunning for 1. Penetrates the target's Defense by 60%.</li>
                    </ul>

                        She was an extremely annoying hero when she first came out.  
                        “This is Navy Captain Landy — 16,000 HP, 1,400 DEF, can equip a greatsword, counterattacks grant a 20% turn boost, ATK can increase by up to 50%, restores HP, immune to stun and sleep, has 70 innate critical resistance, starts the battle with a teamwide 50% DEF shield, and her ultimate skill increases ATK by 50% beforehand, penetrating 60% of enemy DEF — and that stun, THAT STUN, AHHHHHHHHHHH!”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But now, she’s not that powerful anymore. Many heroes can counter her.  
                        Her biggest advantage now is that she can still provide an additional buff.
                    </li>

                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skill 1: Sword Flash.</strong> Cuts the enemy, with a 60% chance to decrease Hit Chance for 1 turn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill 2: Concentration.</strong> Increases Evasion by 50% and after successfully evading, gains 1 Focus. When Focus is at 5 after attacking or being attacked, consumes it all and uses Massacre against a random enemy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill 3: Massacre.</strong> Increases Attack of the caster for 3 turns, before attacking the enemy with a sword. Penetrates Defense by 50%.</li>

                    <strong>My Comment:</strong>
                    <ol>
                    <li>A truly fantastic hero — if you are lucky, he can constantly dodge enemy attacks!</li>
                    <li>However, some heroes have accuracy boosts or additional damage effects, so it is not ideal to pick this hero too early in PvP battles.</li>
